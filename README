Description:
------------
	Pod::Pdf.pm translates the POD content of single files into Adobe
	Portable Document Format.

	The prime intention is a fast and simple utility for creating a 	
	typographically good quality rendering of the POD text suitable for
	screen viewing and printing via Acrobat 'Reader' to a wide variety of
	printers including most low-cost non-postscript ink-jet printers. Text
	blocks are justified at the right and left hand margins.

	PDF Outlines (aka Bookmarks) are created from "=head" and "=item"
	elements which also serve as the Table of Contents in the printed version. 	
	Outlines are clickable on screen, and URI links are fully supported.
	File links and other annotations are not supported in this version.
	
	The PDF file may be viewd on screen by a number of utilities, particularly
	Acrobat 'Reader' (free from Adobe), GhostScript, AcrobatViewer (Java
	Application) and for Apple users, directly on MacOS X. The PDF format
	is to level 1.2.

	The module is intended to function properly on all machine systems.
	Any bug or problem reports and suggestions for improvement will be
	welcomed by the author.

Prerequisites:
--------------
    perl 5.004
    Adobe's 'Acrobat Reader' (see note above)

Build/Installation:
-------------------
    Standard build/installation supported by ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3)...
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	
	On MacOS it is best to have the CPAN module 'cpan-mac-0.40' installed.
	However be prepared for a warning that ":scripts:MacOS:Pod2Pdf.dpl.bin"
	is missing, because "tarzipme.plx" also unpacks the ".bin" file causing
	a lexical discrepancy and a checksum mismatch.
